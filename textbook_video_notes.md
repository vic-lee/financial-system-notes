## Chapter 1: introduction

### 6 parts of the financial system:

1. **Money**: payment; storage of wealth
2. **Financial instruments**: transfer money from savers to those who need it, and to transfer risk to those who can best bear it
3. **Financial markets**: allow us to buy / sell financial instruments cheaply
4. **Financial institutions**: give people access to financial markets
5. **Regulatory agencies**: ensure elements in the financial system (instruments, markets, institutions) operate in a safe manner
6. **Central banks**: monitoring and stabilizing the economy

### 5 core principles of money and banking (TRIMS)

1. **Time**
    - wage = cost of your time
    - time value of money
2. **Risk**
    - *Risk requires compensation.*
    - It is often possible to pay someone to transfer certain risks (uncertainties)
    - No one will assume your risk for free
3. **Information**
    - *Information is the basis for decisions.*
    - Collecting and processing information is the foundation of the financial system.
    - Both sides of the transaction require having adequate information (car loan example).
4. **Markets**
   - Market allocation of resources is efficient.
5. **Stability**
   - *Stability improves welfare.*
   - Markets instability => higher risk => requires higher compensation.

## Chapter 2: money and the banking system

### Part 1: what is money

**Money** is an asset that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services, or repayment of debt.

#### Properties of money

1. **A means of payment**
2. **A unit of account**
3. **A store of value**

*Liquidity* is the ease with which an asset can be turned into into a means of payment (without losing value).

### Part 2: inflation, payment system, economic growth

#### Payment system

Forms of payment:
- money: commodity money, fiat money
- checks
- electronic transactions
  - debit cards
  - credit cards
  - electronic funds transfers

**Commodity money**: actual commodities (butter, silk) used as a means of payment

**Fiat money**: derives its value from government decree

Unlike fiat money, **checks** are not legal tenders. They're instructions for the bank to transfer your money to the counterparty you've specified.

**Debit cards** work like a check; it directly instructs the bank to transfer funds from your account to the merchant's account.

**Credit cards** represent a bank's willingness to lend you money. It deos not represent money; rather, it represents an access to someone else's money.

#### Factors changing money supply (MS)

1. Changes in interest rates
2. Economic growth
3. Inflation: the pace at which general prices are increasing over time

#### Money aggregates (measure money in circulation)

```
// M1 are all assets that can be used directly as means of payments
M1  = currency in public
    + traveler's checks
    + demand deposits
    + other checkable deposits

// M2 includes M1 and assets that are highly liquid
M2  = M1
    + small-denomination time deposits
    + savings deposits; money market deposit accounts
    + retail money market mutual fund shares
```

Today, M2 is more widely used to predict inflation (it used to be M1 until the 1980s). However, M2 has also become less effective overtime.

## Chapter 3: Financial instruments, markets, and institutions

### Financial instruments

A **financial instrument** is a *written legal obligation* of one party to transfer something of value (usually money) to another party at some future date, under specified conditions.

- *Written legal obligation*: enforced by the government
- *Transfer of value at a future date*: will pay money back
- *Under specified conditions*: also specifies penalties for violating agreements

#### Primary functions

1. Store of value (similar to money)
2. Means of payment (similar to money)
3. Transfer of risk (*not* similar to money)
   - e.g. insurance (pay a fee in exchange for assumption of risk by the insurance company)

**Standardization**
- minimizes costs in creating financial instruments,
- helps buyer and seller understand what to expect from such instruments,

#### Classes: primitive & derivative

**Primitive securities**: savers & lenders *directly* transfer resources to investors and borrowers.

**Derivative securities**: value and payoffs *derived* from the underlying, primitive, securities.

#### Factors affecting the value of a financial instrument

1. Size of the payment
2. Timing of the payment
   - The sooner, the more valuable
3. Likelihoood payment will be made
   - Risk requires compensation
   - Information is the basis for decision making
5. Circumstances under which the payment is to be made
   - e.g. macro-economic environment

### Financial markets

**Financial markets** are where financial instruments are bought and sold.

#### Key roles

1. Offer savers and borrowers liquidity
   - Makes buying and selling financial instruments very easy (easy to transform an asset into a means of exchange without losing value, which is the definition of liquidity)
2. Pool and communicate information
   - Information is summarized in the form of *prices*
3. Allow risk sharing
   - Buying / selling financial instruments allow us to take on risks that we're willing to take, and getting rid of risks we don't want (taking on a company's risk by buying its equity; transfering risk of an asset by purchasing its derivatives)

#### Categories

##### Primary vs. secondary

**Primary financial markets** are markets in which a borrower obtains funds from a lender from *newly issued securities*.

**Secondary financial markets** are markets in which securities from the primary financial markets are bought and re-sold.

##### How they execute trades

1. **Centralized exchanges**
   - gather orders (used to be in-person, now electronically) and execute them
2. **Over-the-counter (OTC) Markets**
   - dealers communicate directly with one another via computers
3. **Electronic Communications Networks (ECNs)**
   - allow traders / brokers to find counterparties wishing to trade specific instruments

##### Underlying vs derivative

- **Underlying instrument markets**: debt, equity
- **Derivative markets**: futures, options, swaps

## Chapter 4: Future value, present value, interest rates

**Future value**: the value on some future date of an investment made today.
  - To know how much today's investment is worth in a future date
  - To know how much we should invest, to receive a certain amount in a future date

**Bond** is a financial instrument issued by a borrower who promises to make a series of payments on specific future dates.

## Chapter 5: risk

**Risk** is a measure of the uncertainty about the future payoff to an investment, assessed over some time horizon, and relative to a benchmark.

- *measure*: risk is quantifiable
- risk arises from uncertainty about future payoffs
- risk is considered in the context of an investment
- risk is defined by the period you're holding that investment
- risk is comparative

### Measures of risk

1. **Standard deviation** (volatility)
2. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: worst case scenario assessment

## Chapter 6: bonds, bond prices, and the determination of interest rates

### Types of bonds

1. **Zero-coupon bonds**: single future payment (e.g. T-bill)
2. **Fixed payment loans**: fixed payments (e.g. mortgage)
3. **Coupon bonds**: periodic coupon payments + principal repayment at maturity
4. **Consols**: periodic interest payments forever without repaying principal

### Bond yields

Bond price < Face value: coupon rate < current yield < yield to maturity

Bond price = Face value: coupon rate = current yield = yield to maturity

Bond price > Face value: coupon rate > current yield > yield to maturity

### Factors shifting bond supply

1. Changes in government borrowing
   1. changes in tax policy
   2. Adjustments in spending
   3. In general, increased gov't borrowing => lower price, higher yield
2. Changes in business conditions
   1. Improvement in business conditions => lower bond price, higher interest rate
3. Changes in expected inflation
   1. Higher expected inflation => lower real cost of repayment
      1. => lower bond price, higher interest rate

#### Factors that shift bond demand

1. Wealth
   - more wealth => higher demand for bonds => higher bond price
2. Expected inflation
   - decline in expected inflation => bonds with fixed nominal payments more desirable => more demand => higher bond price
3. Expected return on alternative investments
   - expected bond return increases compared to alternatives => higher demand => higher bond price 
4. Expected interest rates
   - Expected fall in interest rates => higher bond demand => higher bond prices
5. Risk relative to alternatives
   - Bonds less risky => higher demand => higher bond price
6. Liquidity relative to alternatives
   - Increase in liquidity => higher bond price

#### What makes bond risky

1. Default risk: does not make promised payment on time
2. Inflation risk: can't be sure of the *real* value of future payment
3. Interest rate risk: unexpected increase in interest rate (during the holding period of the bond) eats into the investor's profit

## Chapter 7: Ratings and the risk structure of interest rates

Bonds differ in two important ways:

1. The identity of the issuer
2. The time to maturity

### Identity of the issuer

**Rating agencies**: firms which estimate the likelihood that a borrower will make a bond's promised payments.

**Commercial paper** is a short-term of a bond. Their time to maturity is less than 270 days. There's no collerals for CPs, so only the most credit-worthy institutions issue CP.

Yield of the U.S. T-bond is the benchmark.

`Bond yield = U.S. Treasury yield (the benchmark yield) + Default risk premium (risk spread)`

- The lower the issuer's rating, the larger the default premium
- When treasury yields move, all other yields move with them (provided the risk spread doesn't change)

Investor considers after-tax return for bond yields. Some bonds (municipal bonds (bonds issued by state and local gov'ts) are tax-exempt).

### Difference in time to maturity

**Term structure of interest rates**: the relationship among bonds with the same risk characteristics but different maturities.

- Long-term yields > short-term bonds (usually)
- Short-term interest rates tend to be more volatile
- Interest rates of different maturities move togeter

**Explanations:**

- **The expectation hypothesis**: Long-term interest rates are an average of the future shorter-term interest rates
  - Explains why ST & LT interest rates move together, and that ST interest rates are more volatile
  - Does not explain why ST < LT interest rates
    - Drop the assumption that LT bonds have the same risk; LT bonds have higher risks (inflation, interest rate movements, etc.), thus requiring more compensation
- **Liquidity Premium Theory**
  - `Bond yield = rf yield + risk premium`.
  - The expectations hypothesis explains the risk-free yield.
  - The inflation and interest rate risk explains the risk premium.
